    # Typography
    Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable and appealing when displayed. The arrangement of type involves selecting typefaces, point sizes, line lengths, line-spacing (leading), and letter-spacing (tracking), and adjusting the space between pairs of letters (kerning). The term typography is also applied to the style, arrangement, and appearance of the letters, numbers, and symbols created by the process. Type design is a closely related craft, sometimes considered part of typography; most typographers do not design typefaces, and some type designers do not consider themselves typographers. Typography also may be used as an ornamental and decorative device, unrelated to the communication of information.
    Typography is the work of typesetters (also known as compositors), typographers, graphic designers, art directors, manga artists, comic book artists, and, now, anyone who arranges words, letters, numbers, and symbols for publication, display, or distribution, from clerical workers and newsletter writers to anyone self-publishing materials. Until the Digital Age, typography was a specialized occupation. Digitization opened up typography to new generations of previously unrelated designers and lay users. As the capability to create typography has become ubiquitous, the application of principles and best practices developed over generations of skilled workers and professionals has diminished. Thus, at a time when scientific techniques can provide evidence that supports established practice (legibility or brand recognition achieved through the appropriate use of serifs, letter case, letter forms, contrast, spacing, etc.) through understanding the limitations of human vision, typography may be encountered that fails to achieve its principal objective: effective communication.

    君とのラブストーリー それは予想通り<br/>
    いざ始まればひとり芝居だ<br/>
    ずっとそばにいたって 結局ただの観客だ

    感情のないアイムソーリー それはいつも通り<br/>
    慣れてしまえば悪くはないけど<br/>
    君とのロマンスは人生柄 続きはしないことを知った

    もっと違う設定で もっと違う関係で<br/>
    出会える世界線 選べたらよかった<br/>
    もっと違う性格で もっと違う価値観で<br/>
    愛を伝えられたらいいな そう願っても無駄だから

    グッバイ 君の運命のヒトは僕じゃない<br/>
    辛いけど否めない でも離れ難いのさ<br/>
    その髪に触れただけで 痛いや いやでも 甘いな いやいや<br/>
    グッバイ それじゃ僕にとって君は何?<br/>
    答えは分からない 分かりたくもないのさ<br/>
    たったひとつ確かなことがあるとするのならば<br/>
    「君は綺麗だ」
