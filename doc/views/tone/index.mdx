    ### Let's have a different feeling
    Please select a different color:
    <ThemeList />
    In the Material Design 3, the color has become the first class citizen in the visual elements, so it's nice to have theme switching feature in the app.
    If you have ever used Android 12, you must have found that the tone is based on your wallpaper, as well as Windows 11.
    So let's try this ðŸ‘‡:
    <SelectImage />
    Now the tone is based on your image. Somehow there would be some weird color patterns.

    ### Color type
    There are two kind of colors defined in Lancet:

     - Tonal: Used as the theme color by many components, like the background of a button.
     - Text: The text color of your app, just what you see right now.

    You can change them at anytime to have a different looking.
    Each type has four color schemes defined. Check the next section for more.

    ### Color Scheme
    There are four color schemes defined in Lancet:

     - Primary: The main color. This color is used in regular situations.
     - Warn: Used in the situation which warns the user by some components.
     - Error: Used in the situation which tells the user an error has come out.
     - Success: Used in the situation which tells the user something has been done successfully.

    Most of the components use **Primary** as its main color by default. However there are some components use a different one, such as a warning or error toast.
    The good news is, the color scheme of most components can be changed:

    ```tsx
    // A primary color button by default:
    <LctBtn />

    // Now you have an error color button:
    <LctBtn color={LctColorScheme.Error} />
    ```
  </LctCardContent>
</LctCard>

<LctCard>
  <LctCardContent>
    ### Change the color
    You can change the Primary, Warn, Error, Success Color to have a different looking just like what you have seen in the first section.
    But for now, you can't define more themes and mix them up.
